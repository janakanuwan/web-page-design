# react-exercise-1

## Due Date:
March 22, 2019, 23:59 (Friday of Week 9)

## Description
This is an **individual** exercise. The purpose of this exercise is to practice the concepts learned in the Tutorial 4 and React. This exercise has **three** independent parts.


### Part 1: Instructions
**Objective**: Complete the [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) using [create-react-app ](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

1. Use `app-1` as the package/project name for `create-react-app` command.
2. Complete the tutorial by typing code instead of copying directly from the web page.

### Part 2: Instructions
**Objective**: Complete the [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) using webpack <mark>or (create-react-app)</mark>

1. Use `npm` to create a new project/package named as 'app-2' which should be used for this part.
2. Read [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) and follow the codes.
3. Each class should reside in a separate JS/JSX file.
4. Complete the guide by typing code instead of copying directly from web page.

### Part 3: Instructions <mark>Optional</mark>
**Objective**: Extend the [webpack-example-react-3](https://github.com/janakanuwan/web-page-design/tree/master/webpack-example-react-3) to support searching heroes

1. Use `npm` to create a new project/package named as '**tutorial4-<MATRIC_NUMBER>**' (e.g. _tutorial4-a0123456b_) which should be used for this part. Use **your name** as the author.
2. Setting up a mock server to load data via HTTP.
	- Install '[json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)' as a development dependency (i.e. `npm i -D json-server`).
	- Create a `test` directory inside the project directory (e.g. `mkdir test`).
	- Copy [heroes_db.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janakanuwan/web-page-design/master/webpack-example-react-3/test/heroes_db.json) to `test` directory. (Original Source: [superhero-api](https://github.com/akabab/superhero-api))
	- Add `json-server --watch test/heroes_db.json` to `packge.json` as a script.
	- Start the server using `npm run mock:REST` on a different terminal. (Why? This process will not exit until server runs)
	- Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/heroes/` and you should be able to see all heroes.
	- Using 'GET' request type you can obtain heroes data.


3. You must use '[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)' load the data from server (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/heroes/1` for hero with id=1) .
**NOTE:** Now hero data is different than before! Hint: For image use 'images.sm' property as the image source.

    }
  }
```
4. Use all the powers (now there are 6 types instead of 4) in Hero's view
```javascript
// e.g.
powerstats: {
  intelligence: 38,
  strength: 100,
  speed: 17,
  durability: 80,
  power: 24,
  combat: 64
}
```
5. Add buttons to increment and decrement all powers (You are free to choose the button types, widths, sizes, icons)
  - NOTE: since there are 12 buttons, think about the user experience

6. You have to add a "search" (text) field to each publisher and when you type, heroes (whose name or part of the name) matching the typed text should be displayed.

7. You should only use React state (e.g. no redux)

8. You are free to change sizes/properties of any component or create new components to make the look and feel of web page better


## Final Instructions
1. Compress <strike>above 3 parts</strike> <mark>part 1 and part 2</mark> (directories) into `Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>.zip` **without** `node_modules` in each directory. <mark>(If you already have completed all parts, feel free to upload part 3 as well)</mark>
2. Submit it to IVLE.

## Deliverables:
- The **compressed folder** with name `Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>` for <strike>all three parts</stike> <mark>first two parts</mark>
- An **instruction file** on how to the run the code (e.g. _README.md_ file) **inside** each of your _project folders_

## Submitting Exercise
All deliverables should be archived into a .zip file with the following naming convention:
```
Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>.zip
```
